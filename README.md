TP_03:This query demonstrates the number of times messages were sent during the day (12 pm - 6pm) and what community they belonged to. From a managerial aspect, this would be important because it demonstrates the pattern of when group members are more active and what type of groups are interactive at certain times. This can help with knowing when are peak times to post specific ads or to learn when group members are not active and work to make the group interactive during the other times of day.

TP_Q6: This query displays all the account info with the community they belong to only for the accounts that use content scheduling. From a managerial aspect, the query is important because it captures the pattern of the groups who use content scheduling. This helps by telling us which groups/accounts do not use it and with that information, we can find out why they don't and what we can do to encourage them to use the feature.
